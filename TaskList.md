## Task List

- [x] Check if function is called on a weekend
- [ ] Different functions based on joystick direction: Up toggles lights on/off displaying today's info, left goes back to previous day(s), right pulls in and displays current price of individual positions held, maybe down pulls in financial news relating to positions? Or some other info? Not sure what APIs are available.
- [x] Start price should be previous day's close @ 15:30 then change is open of every hour but then if the function is called after 16:30 the final column lights up the 15:30 close.
